        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In the little village where I was born life moved at a slower pace yet felt all the richer for it. 
        There my two uncles were known far and wide for their delicious cooking they seasoned their zested chicken using only the freshest herbs and spices, 
        people called them Los Pollos Hermanos, The Chicken Brothers.</p>
        <p>Today we carry on their tradition that would make my uncles proud. 
            The finest ingredients are brought together with love and care. 
            Then slow cooked to perfection, yes, the old ways are still best at Los Pollos Hermanos. 
            But dont take my word for it, one taste and you'll know.</p>
        <p>But before we jump into cooking, you'll need the following ingridients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Batter (ignore the bag of blue candy in the batter bucket)</li>
            <li>Herbs</li>
            <li>Spices</li>
            <li>Box cutter</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now we can start cooking</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Dunk the whole chicken into the bucket of batter</li>
            <li>Turn on the deep fryer</li>
            <li>Open all the gas valve in your house</li>
            <li>Set up a slide to slowly lower your chicken into the deep fryer</li>
            <li>Slowly walk outside to avoid the explosion (don't forget to not look back)</li>
            <li>Drive away</li>
        </ol>
